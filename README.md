Implementing deep reinforcement learning for a game.

This is for educational purposes only. I have implemented a deep reinforcement learning agent that plays a game in JavaScript using
tensorflow and processing libraries.

I am inspired by [Daniel Shiffman](https://natureofcode.com/book/). I have learnt everything I know about machine learning from Daniel Shiffman.
